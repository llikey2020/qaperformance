```

## Configuration options

The provided configuration is for testig purposes, for production use you may need further configuration, as typical for these type of components.
- The storage for influxDB can be defined in the `values.yaml`
  - If no storageClass is provided, an `EmptyDir` will be allocated: the dashboard history will be lost when the
   underlying pod is restarted. You may rather want to use a persistent backend in the configuration.
- The services exposed by `grafana` and `influx` in the example are of type `NodePort`. You can use `LoadBalancer` type if your Kubernetes distribution supports it.
